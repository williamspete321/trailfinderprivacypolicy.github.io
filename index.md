# TRAIL FINDER PRIVACY POLICY
This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Trail Finder (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by Amboseli Apps, and developer Peter Williams. The Application finds hiking trails near the user’s location and provides helpful information about the hiking trails.

## What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?
The Application obtains the user’s mobile device location, after permission is granted, to find hiking trails, using the Hiking Project Data API, that are near the location when the Application is in use. If the Application is not in the foreground, and if the user is not seeking to find new hiking trails, the Application does not actively collect the user’s location.

## User Provided Information 
The Application does not obtain or request any user information outside the user’s location.

## Automatically Collected Information 
The Application does not collect any information automatically without the user’s permission. When first opening the Application, the user will be asked for permission for the Application to use the device’s location.

## Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?
If the user grants permission to the Application to use the device’s location, the Application uses GPS technology to determine your current location in order to determine the hiking trails nearest you. Your location is not shared, recorded, tracked, known to Amboseli Apps or the developer, or used in any other way. If you do not want the Application to use your location for the purposes set forth above, you can deny the Application permission to use your location. The Application will then close and its services, finding hiking trails near your location, will not be usable.

## Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?
No third parties see or have access to information obtained by the Application.

## What are my opt-out rights?
You can choose not to share your location and the Application will simply close. After granting the Application access to the device’s location, you can later decide to stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. You can also deny the Application access to your location in your device settings if location permissions were previously granted. 

## Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information
No data or user information is retained or used by Amboseli Apps, or the developer, or any other party.
